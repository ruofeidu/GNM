# GNM: Generative aNthropometric Model

**GNM** is a state-of-the-art parametric 3D statistical model of the human
head, learned from a large dataset of 3D scans. It provides fine-grained control
over facial identity, expressions, and head pose. This repository contains the
core NumPy and Jax based GNM model implementation, and tools for visualization
and semantic sampling of parameters.

## Features

*   **Detailed 3D Face Geometry:** Generates a dense 3D face mesh comprised of the skin, the eyes, the teeth, and the tongue.
*   **Disentangled Control:** Offers separate parameters for:
    *   **Identity:** Controls subject-specific facial features.
    *   **Expression:** Animates the face with a rich set of expression blendshapes.
    *   **Head Pose:** Controls the rotation of the neck and eyeballs.
    *   **Translation:** Controls the global position.
*   **Semantic Parameter Sampling:** Includes pre-trained models to generate identity and expression parameters from semantic labels:
    *   `ExpressionSampler`: Generate expressions like "happy", "surprise", or blend them.
    *   `IdentitySampler`: Generate identities based on attributes like gender and ethnicity.
*   **NumPy Implementation:** Easy to integrate into existing Python pipelines.
*   **Permissive License:** Apache 2.0.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/google/gnm.git
    cd gnm/shape
    ```

2.  Create virtual environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate gnm
    pip install -e .
    ```

    NOTE: Due to the dependency on the Tensorflow package, The Python version is
    currently limited to 3.13.

## Getting Started

### Loading the GNM Model

The core model can be loaded as follows. The necessary model data (`gnm.npz`)
is included in this repository.

```python
from gnm.shape import gnm_numpy
from gnm.shape import semantic_sampler
import numpy as np
import trimesh # For visualization

# Load the GNM head model.
gnm = gnm_numpy.GNM.from_local(
    version=gnm_numpy.GNMMajorVersion.V3,
    variant=gnm_numpy.GNMVariant.HEAD,
)

# Get the template (average) face mesh.
template_vertices = gnm.template_vertex_positions
faces = gnm.triangles

# Save or visualize the mesh (example using trimesh).
mesh = trimesh.Trimesh(vertices=template_vertices, faces=faces, process=False)
# mesh.show()
mesh.export("template_face.obj")
```

### Basic Parameter Manipulation
You can generate a mesh by providing parameters for identity, expression,
joint rotations, and translation.

```python
import trimesh

# Zero parameters result in the template face.
identity = np.zeros(gnm.identity_dim)
expression = np.zeros(gnm.expression_dim)
rotations = np.zeros((gnm.num_joints, 3)) # Axis-angle
translation = np.zeros((3,))

vertices = gnm(identity, expression, rotations, translation)
mesh = trimesh.Trimesh(vertices=vertices, faces=faces, process=False)
mesh.show()
```

### Demo

To experiment with generating a human head mesh from custom identity,
expression, joint rotations and global translation, please see
`gnm/shape/demos/gnm_head_demo.ipynb`.

## Using the Semantic Sampler
Generate meaningful identity and expression parameters using the
`ExpressionSampler` and `IdentitySampler`.

### Expression Sampling
```python
expr_sampler = semantic_sampler.ExpressionSampler()

# Available expression labels.
print(expr_sampler.expression_label_mapping)

# Sample a 'happy' expression.
happy_expression = expr_sampler.sample_expression(
    semantic_sampler.Expression.HAPPY, num_samples=1
)[0]

vertices_happy = gnm(expression=happy_expression)
mesh_happy = trimesh.Trimesh(vertices=vertices_happy, faces=faces)
mesh_happy.show()
mesh_happy.export("happy_face.obj")
```

### Identity Sampling
```python
id_sampler = semantic_sampler.IdentitySampler()

# Explain available classes.
print(id_sampler.explain_classes())

# Sample a specific identity.
identity_sample = id_sampler.sample_identity(
    semantic_sampler.Gender.FEMALE,
    semantic_sampler.Ethnicity.ASIAN,
    num_samples=1
)[0]

vertices_identity = gnm(identity=identity_sample)
mesh_identity = trimesh.Trimesh(vertices=vertices_identity, faces=faces)
mesh_identity.show()
mesh_identity.export("sampled_identity_face.obj")
```

### Demo
To experiment with identity and expression sampling and blending, please see
`gnm/shape/demos/semantic_gnm_demo.ipynb`.

## Model Parameters

The GNM model is controlled by two primary sets of coefficients that determine
the identity and expression of the generated face. The following dimensions are
relevant for the GNM v3.x.

### Identity Parameters

*   **Shape:** `[batch_size, 253]`
*   **Description:** Controls the unique physical characteristics of the individual. These are divided into:
    *   **170** Head components
    *   **3** Eyeball components
    *   **80** Teeth components
*   **Total:** 253 identity components.
*   **Typical Range:** -3 to +3

### Expression Parameters

*   **Shape:** `[batch_size, 383]`
*   **Description:** Controls the facial movement and blendshape weights. These are divided into:
    *   **100** Left eye components
    *   **100** Right eye components
    *   **150** Lower face components
    *   **32** Tongue components
    *   **1** Iris component
*   **Total:** 383 expression components.
*   **Typical Range:** -3 to +3.

### Joint Parameters

*   **Shape:** rotations: `[batch_size, 4x3 Rotation matrix]`, global translation: `[batch_size, 3]`
*   **Description:** Controls the global head position and joint angles for head pose and eyeball orientation.

## Model Data
The GNM model data (e.g., `gnm_head.npz`) contains the template shape, identity
basis, expression basis, skinning weights, and UV layout. This file is provided
within the `gnm/shape/data/versions/v{MAJOR}_{MINOR}` directory.

The Semantic Sampler models
(`expression_decoder_model.h5`, `identity_decoder_model.h5`) are located as
in `gnm/shape/data/semantic_sampler`.

## Model Limitations in Human Representation
This model was trained on datasets using binary gender categories and four broad
demographic groups based on conventions in 3DMM literature and data
availability. These categories do not fully represent the spectrum of human
gender identities or the full diversity of the global population. Please see the
technical report for a more detailed discussion of these limitations and the
dataset statistics. Users should be aware of these limitations and consider the
potential implications for fairness and representation in their specific
applications.
